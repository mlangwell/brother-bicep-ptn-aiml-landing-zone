# Azure AI Landing Zone integrated deployment

This repository deploys an Azure AI Landing Zone (AILZ) spoke into an existing
Azure Landing Zone hub. Use
[Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1](Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1) to configure the `azd`
environment, preview the infrastructure changes, and provision the deployment.

An additive, opt-in [GitHub development environment path](docs/github-development.md)
adds typed dev/test/prod profiles, protected artifact promotion, a private APIM
gateway and a small authenticated inference starter. Infrastructure success is
not developer readiness: private completion, human SSO and the live acceptance
gates are separate. The existing wrapper, `azd` hooks and Azure DevOps assets
remain supported and unchanged.

The script configures this topology automatically:

- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=ailz-integrated`
- `NETWORK_ISOLATION=true`
- `DEPLOY_AZURE_FIREWALL=false`
- Spoke-to-hub peering using the supplied hub VNet resource ID
- Spoke egress through the supplied hub firewall or NVA private IP

## Quickstart: let Copilot find your values and deploy

Assembling the deployment command by hand is the step most people get wrong. It
means collecting a dozen resource IDs across two or three subscriptions without
a typo. Two prompts in
[Deploy with GitHub Copilot](docs/copilot-deploy-prompt.md) do it for you:

1. **Discover.** Copilot uses the Azure CLI to find your hub VNet, firewall
   private IP, Private DNS zones and observability resources, then writes a
   filled-in `config.json`. It only reads from Azure and changes nothing.
2. **Deploy.** Copilot validates that file, checks your spoke range does not
   overlap the hub, builds the correct command, runs a preview, and stops for
   your approval before provisioning.

[config.json.example](config.json.example) is the template behind both. It is a
commented worksheet covering the four required values, subscription and resource
group targeting, hub observability reuse, Private DNS strategy for a
policy-managed landing zone, the spoke address range, and the optional feature
flags. You can fill it in by hand instead:

```powershell
Copy-Item config.json.example config.json
code config.json
```

`config.json` is git-ignored because it holds subscription and hub identifiers.
Commit changes to `config.json.example` only.

Prefer to drive the script directly? The rest of this document is the full
parameter reference, and it remains the authoritative description of the script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, confirm that you have:

1. [PowerShell 7 or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).
2. [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
3. [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
4. Azure `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles at the deployment
  scope.
5. Accepted the Responsible AI terms for Azure AI services.
6. The full Azure resource ID of the existing hub VNet.
7. The private IP address of the hub Azure Firewall or other next-hop NVA.
8. A non-overlapping address range available for the new spoke VNet. The
  default spoke range in this checkout is `192.168.0.0/21`.
9. Hub firewall policy rules that allow the spoke address range to reach the
  required Azure services.

Open PowerShell 7 in the repository root before following the steps below.

## Deployment script parameters

The script has four required parameters. The remaining parameters are optional.

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EnvironmentName` | Yes | Name of the local `azd` environment to create or reuse. Use a short name that identifies the workload and lifecycle environment. Reusing a name also reuses values saved by earlier runs. | `ailz-dev` |
| `Location` | Yes | Primary Azure region for the deployment. Use an Azure region name without spaces. Resource availability and organizational policy may restrict the allowed regions. | `eastus2` |
| `HubVnetResourceId` | Yes | Full Azure resource ID of the existing hub virtual network. The deployment uses it to create the spoke-to-hub peering. | `/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<hub-vnet>` |
| `EgressNextHopIp` | Yes | Private IPv4 address of the hub Azure Firewall or network virtual appliance that receives the spoke's default route. Do not use its public IP. | `10.100.0.4` |
| `ExistingLogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId` | No | Full resource ID of a hub-managed Log Analytics workspace to reuse. Leave it out to deploy a new workspace. | `/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<name>` |
| `ExistingApplicationInsightsResourceId` | No | Full resource ID of an existing Application Insights component to reuse. It must be supplied together with `ExistingApplicationInsightsConnectionString`. Leave both out to deploy a new component. | `/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Insights/components/<name>` |
| `ExistingApplicationInsightsConnectionString` | No | Connection string belonging to the reused Application Insights component. Store it in a PowerShell variable before invoking the script so it is not typed directly into the command. | `$applicationInsightsConnectionString` |
| `AdditionalEnvironmentVariables` | No | PowerShell hashtable containing additional `azd` environment values supported by `main.parameters.json`, such as subscription, resource group, private DNS zone IDs, or feature flags. Values persist in the selected local `azd` environment. | `@{ AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<id>" }` |
| `PreviewOnly` | No | Switch that stops after `azd provision --preview`. Without it, the script displays the preview and then asks you to type `DEPLOY` before provisioning. | `-PreviewOnly` |

### Find the required values

List the Azure regions available to your subscription:

```powershell
az account list-locations --query "[].name" --output table
```

Get the hub VNet resource ID:

```powershell
$hubVnetResourceId = az network vnet show `
  --resource-group "<hub-resource-group>" `
  --name "<hub-vnet-name>" `
  --query id `
  --output tsv
```

Get the private IP of an Azure Firewall in the hub:

```powershell
$egressNextHopIp = az network firewall show `
  --resource-group "<hub-resource-group>" `
  --name "<hub-firewall-name>" `
  --query "ipConfigurations[0].privateIPAddress" `
  --output tsv
```

Pass those variables directly to the script:

```powershell
./Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentName "ailz-dev" `
  -Location "eastus2" `
  -HubVnetResourceId $hubVnetResourceId `
  -EgressNextHopIp $egressNextHopIp `
  -PreviewOnly
```

If the hub uses a network virtual appliance instead of Azure Firewall, obtain
its private forwarding IP from the platform or networking team.

## Deploy

### 1. Preview the deployment

Replace the example values, then run:

```powershell
./Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentName "ailz-dev" `
  -Location "eastus2" `
  -HubVnetResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<hub-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<hub-vnet-name>" `
  -EgressNextHopIp "10.100.0.4" `
  -PreviewOnly
```

The script signs in when needed, creates or selects the named `azd`
environment, sets the integrated-topology values, runs the repository's
preflight hook, and displays the Azure deployment preview. `-PreviewOnly`
guarantees that this invocation does not provision resources.

Review the preview for deleted or replaced resources, unexpected role
assignments, public network access, incorrect regions, and changes outside the
intended resource group.

### 2. Provision the deployment

Run the same command without `-PreviewOnly`:

```powershell
./Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentName "ailz-dev" `
  -Location "eastus2" `
  -HubVnetResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<hub-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<hub-vnet-name>" `
  -EgressNextHopIp "10.100.0.4"
```

The script runs the preview again. Type exactly `DEPLOY` when prompted to start
provisioning. Any other response cancels the deployment.

### 3. Complete hub integration

After provisioning:

1. Create the reverse hub-to-spoke VNet peering. The template creates only the
  spoke-to-hub direction.
2. Link the hub-managed private DNS zones to the spoke VNet when Azure Policy
  does not manage those links.
3. Verify that the hub firewall permits the spoke source range and that its DNS
  configuration resolves the private endpoints.
4. Test access from a host with network connectivity to the spoke, such as a
  hub jumpbox reached through Azure Bastion.

See the [hub-and-spoke deployment walkthrough](https://azure.github.io/AI-Landing-Zones/bicep/hub-and-spoke/)
for the post-deployment network checks.

## Optional configuration

### Select the subscription and resource group

Pass additional `azd` environment values in a PowerShell hashtable:

```powershell
./Deploy-AilzIntegrated.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentName "ailz-dev" `
  -Location "eastus2" `
  -HubVnetResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<hub-resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<hub-vnet-name>" `
  -EgressNextHopIp "10.100.0.4" `
  -AdditionalEnvironmentVariables @{
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<subscription-id>"
    AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP  = "<spoke-resource-group-name>"
  } `
  -PreviewOnly
```

Without these values, `azd` uses the subscription and resource group associated
with the selected environment. Check them before deployment:

```powershell
azd env get-value AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP
az account show --query "{subscription:name, subscriptionId:id}" --output table
```

Use targeted `azd env get-value` commands instead of printing the entire
environment because it may contain the Application Insights connection string.

### Reuse hub observability

To reuse an existing Log Analytics workspace:

```powershell
-ExistingLogAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>"
```

To reuse Application Insights, both its resource ID and connection string are
required:

```powershell
-ExistingApplicationInsightsResourceId "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Insights/components/<component-name>" `
-ExistingApplicationInsightsConnectionString $applicationInsightsConnectionString
```

Obtain the connection string without placing it directly in the command:

```powershell
$applicationInsightsConnectionString = az monitor app-insights component show `
  --resource-group "<resource-group>" `
  --app "<component-name>" `
  --query connectionString `
  --output tsv
```

### Reuse private DNS zones or set other values

Use `-AdditionalEnvironmentVariables` for private DNS zone IDs and any other
environment-substituted setting supported by
[main.parameters.json](main.parameters.json):

```powershell
-AdditionalEnvironmentVariables @{
  EXISTING_PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE_BLOB_RESOURCE_ID     = "/subscriptions/.../privateDnsZones/privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
  EXISTING_PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE_KEYVAULT_RESOURCE_ID = "/subscriptions/.../privateDnsZones/privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net"
  DNS_ZONE_LINK_SUFFIX                           = "spoke01"
}
```

Use the exact variable names from the
[AILZ parameter reference](https://azure.github.io/AI-Landing-Zones/bicep/parameterization/).
For hub integration in this checkout, the authoritative names are
`HUB_INTEGRATION_HUB_VNET_RESOURCE_ID` and
`HUB_INTEGRATION_EGRESS_NEXT_HOP_IP`.

These values persist in the local `azd` environment. Do not pass passwords,
tokens, or other application secrets through `-AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`;
store application secrets in Azure Key Vault.

## Troubleshooting

### `Required command '<name>' was not found`

Install the named prerequisite, open a new PowerShell 7 session, and verify it:

```powershell
pwsh --version
az version
azd version
```

### Script execution is disabled

Allow the script only for the current PowerShell process, then rerun it:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Do not weaken the machine-wide execution policy unless your organization has
approved that change.

### Azure sign-in opens the wrong tenant

Sign in to the required tenant before running the script:

```powershell
az login --tenant "<tenant-id>"
azd auth login --tenant-id "<tenant-id>"
```

Then verify and select the intended subscription:

```powershell
az account set --subscription "<subscription-id>"
az account show --output table
```

Also pass `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` through `-AdditionalEnvironmentVariables` so
the `azd` environment targets the same subscription.

### `azd env select` reports that the environment does not exist

This message is expected the first time an environment name is used. The script
creates it immediately afterward. Investigate only if the subsequent
`azd env new` command also fails.

### An existing environment uses unexpected settings

The script reuses an environment when `-EnvironmentName` already exists. It
updates the values supplied on the current run, but it does not remove unrelated
values saved by an earlier run. Inspect the relevant value directly:

```powershell
azd env get-value <VARIABLE_NAME>
```

Use a new, unique `-EnvironmentName` for a clean deployment environment, or
correct the stale value by passing it in `-AdditionalEnvironmentVariables`.

### `ExistingApplicationInsightsResourceId and ... must be supplied together`

Supply both Application Insights parameters shown in the observability example,
or remove both parameters to deploy a new Application Insights component.

### Preflight reports an invalid resource ID or missing resource

Confirm that every ID starts with `/subscriptions/`, uses the correct
subscription and resource group, and refers to a resource visible to the signed-
in identity. Test a resource ID with:

```powershell
az resource show --ids "<resource-id>" --output table
```

### Preflight reports overlapping CIDR ranges

The default spoke range in this checkout is `192.168.0.0/21`. Choose a range
that does not overlap the hub or any connected network. The
`vnetAddressPrefixes` parameter is not currently exposed as an `azd` environment
variable, so add this entry inside the `parameters` object in
[main.parameters.json](main.parameters.json):

```json
"vnetAddressPrefixes": {
  "value": [
    "10.200.0.0/21"
  ]
},
```

Keep enough address space for the template's subnets, rerun with `-PreviewOnly`,
and confirm that preflight accepts the new range before provisioning.

### Authorization or role-assignment failure

Confirm that the signed-in identity has both `Contributor` and `User Access
Administrator` at the target scope. Azure Policy may also deny resource types,
regions, SKUs, public access settings, or role assignments; review the detailed
deployment error and work with the landing-zone platform owner rather than
bypassing policy.

### Hub peering or private endpoint DNS does not work

The deployment creates only spoke-to-hub peering. Create the reverse peering and
confirm that hub Private DNS zones are linked to the spoke or managed by Azure
Policy. Verify that custom DNS servers can resolve Azure Private DNS and that
network security rules permit the traffic.

### Preview succeeds but provisioning fails

A preview validates the proposed control-plane changes but does not guarantee
quota, capacity, data-plane access, or eventual service availability. Read the
first Azure resource error, correct that condition, and rerun the same script.
The script returns a failing exit code when `azd` fails; it does not hide the
underlying deployment error.
